<h1>Things I Learned In Unit 2</h1>

<h2>Which two websites am I most inspired by?</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.tankboys.biz/">Taknboys.biz</a></br>
		Type design with minimal graphics grabs my visual interest. Clean and simple.</li>

		<li><a href="http://10andthree.com/">10andthree.com</a></br>
		Grids that are not too fancy don't just highlight each element, but provides an overall visual theme to the entire site.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.tankboys.biz/">Taknboys.biz</a>: The large type directs users' attention and leads them to discover the content by scrolling down. When mousing over the copy, you immediately learn about the functionality of each headline- which when allowed to be clicked, will automatically take you to a more descriptive page with an interesting transition.</li>

		<li><a href="http://10andthree.com/">10andthree.com</a>: The focal point is simple and obvious, and implies the theme of the rest of the website. You're never overwhelmed nor confused with the content- it literally only allows you to view a couple of items at a time. Scroll, click, enjoy. Completely serves the purpose of this portfolio and doesn't try to be something it's not.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Similarities</h3>
			<p>Both website have a sense of purpose and personality. Both showcase it's content through very direct and simple visual elements. Both utilize grids to drive the user experience.</p></li>

		<li><h3>Differences</h3>
		<p>Even though both peak my visual interest, they both showcase different content. Tankboys actually gives its audience a choice of how to view it's content; the style doesn't change, but the contents can be toggled between images and text.</br>
		10andthree is simply a portfolio of stories told through photography and minimal blurb. No choosing, or toggling- just presenting itself in it's proud and bold design.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1: Templated</strong></br>
				<p>I think this is fairly standard, something you'd find as a blogger template. It's read from left to right, up to down. The bigger sections naturally attrack the eye up to, then moves towards the other sections. There's also an odd shape in there that gives it a visual break from the rest of the boxes.</p>

			</li></br>

			<li><strong>2: Google Doc</strong></br>
				<p>This was way less Googly in my mind before I sketched it out. It looks like something an ex Google employee designed that got him fired. But it's got a focal point in it's natural position, upper left and two columns on the bottom for the eyes to drift to.</p>

			</li></br>

			<li><strong>3: Abstract</strong></br>
				<p>This uses a little bit of the negative space. The title (white bar) would visually connected each content box from left to right. I was imagining the far left to be the image, the center to have the title on top and logo on bottom, then on the right is a blurb about the image. Maybe even an arrow on the ends that when clicked, the contents swipe to the next one.</p>

			</li></br>

			<li><strong>4: Icon Gallery</strong></br>
				<p>The hierchy for thsi one isn't quite normal. I wanted it to look like a thought bubble. It may take the users a second to figure it out. I imagined the smaller boxes to be icon sized thumbnails of artwork, just showing a portion of it. When moused over, the bigger box would display a bigger thumbnail. When clicked, the bigger box expands to show a high resolution image. Blurb at the bottom.</p>

			</li></br>

			<li><strong>5: No Idea How To Make This</strong></br>
				<p>This is likely not the best design for this concept, but I imagined a set of text or images on the left that are too small to view. When moused over, the mouse turns into a magnifying glass. The part that is moused over appears on the right column in a bigger viewable size. The flow is more implied, but the lack of a focal point, I think would lead the viewer to start investigating from the left and discover on the right. There's also a small icon for a logo in between the two column to tie the two columns together. Also, this layout looks like a post card, which most people have seen, which brings a little familiarity.</p>
